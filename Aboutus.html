                    <div class="an"></div>
                    <p>DM homes emerged in 2018 with a strategic <br>initiative to revamp the real estate <br>business model in Africa and attain a clear and distinct market leadership position <br>through creating world-class master-planned <br> communities and offer unrivalled lifestyles.


                        DM homes is a parent company of Pineapple <br>island, DM interior , DMWD.

                       

                        The group, in continuing partnerships with some of the world’s preeminent construction and architectural firms, professionals and equity investors are the evidence of its unwavering integrity, commitment to excellence and outstanding performance. This differentiates us from our competitors in the market and this help us manage our brand perception and relationships with key audiences.
